# PORTFOLIO-PROJECT

This is a personal portfolio website built using only *HTML and Tailwind CSS* as part of the *Devtown Bootcamp* project.

It includes:
- A fully responsive layout
- Four main sections: Home, About Me, Projects, and Contact
- Resume download button
- Hover and transition effects
- Semantic HTML structure
- Clean and organized folder setup

## What I Learned

- Tailwind utility classes (like flex, grid, rounded, hover:)
- Building fully responsive designs for desktop and mobile
- Organizing code and assets professionally

This project helped me build confidence in using Tailwind CSS for real UI projects.
